# PATTMAYNE.COM WEBSITE

This is the code for the current iteration of my personal/professional website.
I've rewritten this many times over the years. It used to be a content management system, and a showcase for my books and music.
Now it's more of a hub for a less-centralized network of projects, and a bit of a business card for my work as a developer.
